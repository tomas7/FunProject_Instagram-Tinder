# About this project
## About this project - Instagram-Tinder
I made this project to test react css transition options and possibilities to control css animations and classes based on this feature(and with props/state).

The project is based on the React.

Soon, I got inspired by UI of Instagram and the animation of Tinder. That is what I used as a design idea.

**Features:**

Modern Sass

Animations powered mainly with css and react transition feature

video tutorial explaining UI and user interaction

**TO-DO:**
A bug with video tutorial - autoplay video not playing.

Deal with a couple of extra re-rendering of certain components

After some time I added a few features and I plan to finish it in near future...
